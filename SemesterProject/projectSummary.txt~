My hypothesis was to determine whether wealthier and more white-dominant areas of New York State receive better health care for Hepatitis C, which would be determined by the drug that they were prescribed. The new developed drug, Harvoni, is able to cure a person with one pill, while older drugs, such as Ribavirin and Sovaldi, require more. I used Ribavirin and Sovalid, two prominent drugs for treating Hep C to compare to Harvoni.

First, I created files that only had the lines of the Medicare data that corresponded to doctors residing in New York and the drugs they prescribed- Harvoni, Ribavirin, and Sovaldi. Then using the NPI number recorded for each line of the Medicare data, I was able to match each record to a zip code. I summed up the total claims prescribed by each doctor (each line of the Medicare file) and wrote them into a pipe-delimited file that had the zip code and the total number for that zip code next to it along with the total amount spent on the drug for that zip code and the average amount that each claim costs. This was done for each drug and year separately. I first did the Harvoni data, and then read in that file and added on the Ribavirin data (either adding the data, or empty spaces for the zip codes in the Harvoni file that did not have Ribavirin data). There were also zip codes that did not appear in the Harvoni file but did in the Ribavirin file so I added pipes with nothing in between so that all the columns aligned properly. After Ribavirin, I looped through that file, adding in the Sovaldi data in a similar fashion. I also used the income data from the census, and made a gawk dictionary organized with the key as the zip code and the data as the mean income and the population size. Using this dictionary, I was able to read through the files with the amount of drugs prescribed for each zip code and add on this information from the census data. Next, I used the zip code data, which gave a percentage of each minority for the zip code and concatenated that to the end of the line and wrote that to a new file. Once I had the data in this format, with each line corresponding to a different zip code, I was ready to graph the data.

I graphed this data in two categories- by race and by income. In order to graph by income, I took the average income per zip code and appended it to a list. Similarly, I appended the amount of corresponding drug per capita (total claims/population) to a different list, with a zero if it was not in the file, so that the lists would be of equal length. Then I graphed the scatterplot with the three different drugs on it. However, there seemed to be a few outliers, which had high numbers for the drugs per capita, and was skewing all the data. After taking out those outliers, it is easier to see the points that are lower down (Both graphs are created in the makefile).

The race data was graphed similar to the income data, but the x axis was the percentage of the minorities in the population rather than income. I appended the appropriate drug information to a list and the race data to a list and graphed them together. This graph also had some outliers, which I took out to be able to see the lower points on the graph.

Looking at the graphs, it does not seem as though there is a trend. The wealthier, “whiter” communities do not have much documented Hepatitis C which could explain the decrease in points as the income or % white increase. But the lack of points on the graph there does not indicate that they receive better healthcare, just that there is not as much Hep C as the other. However, it is possible that those areas have Hepatitis C, but have not been diagnosed. Similarly, the zip codes that are closer to the right of the graph just have more Hepatitis C, but not necessarily better health care for it.

It is interesting that there is not an observable difference between the drugs prescribed and that Harvoni was not any more popular than the other drug; there seemed to be a mix between all of them. It would be interesting to look further into the zip codes that I considered outliers- to figure out where they are, what caused the Hepatitis C rate to be that high, which drugs were more prominent in those areas. Because the percentage of documented Hepatitis C is fairly small, it is shocking that these zip codes have such a high amount of drugs prescribed per capita, especially compared to the majority, which had such a low number. It would also be cool to take into account the percentage of people who walk around with undiagnosed Hepatitis C but that data is not available for obvious reasons.
