My hypothesis for my Linux semester project was that wealthier, more white-dominated areas of New York State receive better health care for Hepatitis C, which can be seen by the drugs patients in those areas are prescribed. The new developed drug, Harvoni, is able to cure a person with one pill, while older drugs, such as Ribavirin and Sovaldi, require more treatment. I used the Medicare data from 2013-2015 to find all reported prescriptions of these drugs in New York State and matched the doctor’s NPI number to sort these records into appropriate zip codes. After compiling each drug’s prescription amount for the zip code, I used the census data to use the population sizes in order to determine the amount of drug prescribed per capita. Using the census data again, I extracted the incomes and race distributions of the zip codes and was able to plot the relationship on a graph.

I found my hypothesis to be incorrect. There did not seem to be a correlation between the wealthier, white dominated areas and prescription of effective drugs. While there are less reported cases of Hepatitis C in these areas, there is no indication that this is due to better health care.
